A **multi-language document classification system** in Java typically involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to categorize text documents based on their content. Here’s a general theory behind such a system:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The system first cleans and processes text by removing stop words, tokenizing sentences, and applying stemming or lemmatization.
2. **Feature Extraction**: It converts text into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
3. **Model Training**: A machine learning model (e.g., Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) is trained on labeled datasets to classify documents.
4. **Multi-Language Support**: The system incorporates language detection and applies language-specific preprocessing techniques.
5. **Classification & Evaluation**: The trained model predicts document categories, and its accuracy is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
